Goal: Fix the “backend not running / curl can’t connect to localhost:8000” issue by wiring the project so Replit’s Run/Stop button starts the correct processes automatically (backend + frontend), without manual shell commands.

Problem (what’s happening)

When I run:

curl -i http://localhost:8000/ui/api/auth-status

I get: Failed to connect to localhost port 8000

This means nothing is listening on port 8000 (backend server not started).

I don’t want to run uvicorn ... manually in the shell every time.

I want Replit’s Run/Stop button to start/stop everything consistently.

Requirements

Create a single workflow that starts:

Backend: FastAPI (uvicorn) on port 8000

Frontend: Vite dev server on port 5173 (or whatever the project uses)

Make the Run button execute one command only (e.g. bash start-dev.sh).

Add/adjust health checks so I can confirm it’s working via:

GET /ui/api/health

GET /ui/api/auth-status

No breaking changes to existing routes.

Keep secrets as-is:

QUILLO_UI_TOKEN and VITE_UI_TOKEN already exist and match.

Ensure the backend binds to 0.0.0.0 not localhost-only.

Implementation plan

A) Add a start script at repo root
Create start-dev.sh that:

starts backend in the background:

python -m uvicorn quillo_agent.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

starts frontend:

cd frontend && npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173

handles Ctrl+C / stop properly (trap and kill child processes)

prints clear logs: “Backend running on :8000”, “Frontend running on :5173”

B) Configure Replit to use that script
Update .replit so Run executes:

bash start-dev.sh

If Replit supports “workflows”, create one named:

Start Uboolia
that runs bash start-dev.sh.

C) Add verification steps
After running, verify:

curl -s http://localhost:8000/ui/api/health

curl -s http://localhost:8000/ui/api/auth-status

If those fail, print backend logs and confirm correct port binding.

D) Add rollback checkpoint
Before changes:

Create git tag: checkpoint-replit-run-pre-YYYYMMDD-HHMM

Then commit:

chore(replit): wire run workflow for backend+frontend

Definition of done

Clicking Run starts both servers every time.

Clicking Stop stops both servers.

curl http://localhost:8000/ui/api/health returns JSON.

curl http://localhost:8000/ui/api/auth-status returns JSON (not connection refused).
