TASK: Make “Offline vs AI-Powered” mode explicit in the Quillo UI (trust layer). Frontend-only changes.

GOAL
Right now the app can execute without OpenRouter/Anthropic keys by using offline fallbacks. We must make that obvious in the UI so it never feels misleading.

SCOPE
- Frontend only. Do NOT change backend code in this task.
- Use the existing API responses and/or existing health check calls.
- Premium, glassy styling consistent with the current UI.

REQUIREMENTS

1) Add an “Intelligence Status” indicator (always visible)
- Location: top bar or near the Backend OK badge (wherever fits the design).
- It should show one of:
  - “AI-Powered” (green-ish / positive)
  - “Offline Mode” (amber / warning)
- Tooltip or helper text:
  - AI-Powered: “Enhanced reasoning enabled via connected model provider.”
  - Offline Mode: “Using offline fallbacks. Connect OpenRouter/Anthropic for best results.”

2) Determine status WITHOUT exposing secrets
Since we can’t change backend, infer from responses:
- When the user runs Ask or Execute, we already display metadata like model/provider_used.
- Rule:
  - If provider_used/model === "offline" → Offline Mode
  - Else → AI-Powered
- Persist this status in UI state so it remains visible after first interaction.

3) Add a “Connect AI Provider” CTA when Offline Mode
- A small button/link next to the Offline indicator: “Connect”
- Clicking opens a modal:
  Title: “Enable AI-Powered Mode”
  Body (simple steps):
    1) Open Replit Secrets / .env
    2) Add OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
    3) Restart the backend
  Footer: “Got it” button
- Do NOT mention any API key values; just instructions.

4) Make execution results clearly label offline outputs
- In ExecutionResultCard:
  - If offline: show a subtle banner at top:
    “Offline output — template-based. Connect AI for stronger judgment.”
  - If AI-powered: show:
    “AI-powered output — enhanced reasoning applied.”

5) Ensure no “dev” language
Replace any labels like “provider” / “artifacts” / “execution trace” in user-facing text.
Internal metadata can remain small/subtle, but user-facing language should be:
- “Mode”, “Steps”, “Why this step”, “Result”, “Confidence” (if present)

6) Quality bar
- No layout break on mobile.
- No TypeScript errors.
- Keep styling consistent with existing premium/glass UI.

DELIVERABLE
- Commit message: "chore(ui): explicit offline vs ai-powered mode"
- Confirm where in the UI the status appears and show the exact text used.
