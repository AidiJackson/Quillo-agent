# Quillo: Your AI Chief of Staff
## Customer Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1: The Problem
**High-stakes communications are overwhelming professionals**

- Executives spend **23 hours/week** managing email and messages
- **40% of conflicts** escalate due to poor tone or unclear messaging
- Writing persuasive proposals takes **3-5 hours** per document
- **No consistent system** for learning from past successes

**Cost**: Lost productivity, damaged relationships, missed deals

---

## Slide 2: Existing Solutions Fall Short
**Current tools are assistants, not advisors**

| Tool | Limitation |
|------|-----------|
| Grammarly | Grammar only, no strategic thinking |
| ChatGPT | No context, no memory, generic responses |
| Email templates | Rigid, not adaptive |
| Executive coaches | $300+/hour, not scalable |

**What's missing**: Context-aware intelligence that learns and adapts
